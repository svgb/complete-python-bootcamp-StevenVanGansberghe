# complete-python-bootcamp
Chapters 1 and 2 are chapters where you install your python setup.
Chapters 3-6 contain the basics of Python.
Chapter 7 is a first project, in this project I made a tic-tac-toe game.
Chapters 8-10 are more advanced programming chapters, I have done chapter 9 outside of the Jupyter Notebook, I followed the lessons and tried to do the same as the person explaining it.
Chapter 11 is another project, here I made a blackjack game.
Chapters 12 and 13 were again some more advanced topics.
Chapter 14 gives you a chance to make a project on your own, completely choose what you want to do. This chapter is just there to tell you that you are ready to program in Python on your own. It doesn't really give you an assignment.
Finally chapters 15-16 are the last chapters, they are about modules, objects and data structures.
Chapter 17 is there as a bonus, it's about GUI's.
The course also gives me all the older material for Python2 for if you would need that ever in your life.
